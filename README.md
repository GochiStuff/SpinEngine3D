SpinEngine3D
SpinEngine3D is a simple 3D cube rendering engine built with SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) that demonstrates basic 3D transformations, including rotation along the X and Y axes. This project is a starting point for more advanced 3D graphics and real-time rendering applications, showcasing smooth animation and cube projection with simple mathematical calculations.

Features
Smooth Rotation: The cube rotates continuously on the X and Y axes, providing dynamic visualization of 3D transformations.
Perspective Projection: A simple perspective projection is used to simulate depth and create a 3D effect on the 2D screen.
Customizable Cube: Easily modify the size and speed of the rotating cube.
Background Gradient: Gradual color transitions for a smooth and visually appealing background.
Simple Codebase: The code is modular, clean, and easy to understand, making it a good starting point for developers learning 3D graphics programming.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To build and run SpinEngine3D, you'll need:

C++ Compiler: GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio (ensure C++11 or later is supported).
SFML Library: Install SFML for graphics, window management, and system events.
